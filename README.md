This repository contains my Virtual CV, a personal web-based portfolio developed using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to provide a professional and interactive online resume that outlines my background, education, skills, experience, and projects. It is intended to support job applications, internship opportunities, and professional networking.

The website is fully responsive and designed to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes. It offers a clear layout that allows visitors to quickly learn more about who I am, what I can do, and how to contact me. The site includes key sections such as About Me, Education, Skills, Experience, Projects, and Contact Information.

This project was created using only HTML and CSS to demonstrate my understanding of front-end development basics. Git and GitHub were used for version control, and the site is deployed using GitHub Pages, making it publicly accessible.

If you wish to run the project locally, you can clone the repository, navigate to the project folder, and open the index.html file in a web browser.

I developed this virtual CV as part of my personal branding efforts and as a digital supplement to traditional job application materials. It reflects my academic journey, technical capabilities, and career interests in cloud data engineering and software development.
